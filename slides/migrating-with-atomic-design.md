> You Should Never Throw Away Your Codebase And Start Over

???

- mantra has mostly served the software engineering community well
- made famous by Joel Spolsky

???

- has stood up amazingly well since 2000, because building something from scratch is not advised unless you've got a good reason
- this was written right before the dot-com bubble popped, the startup climate could be described as chaotic. If you were a leader in any space there was likely to be several startups waiting for their chance.

# Never rewrite gets _less true_ over time

???

- Codebases grow unwieldy over time.
- Maybe you keep ahead of your tech debt and you push that back.
- Maybe you pile it up and you get into a situation like this:

<img src="{{baseurl}}/images/MigrateWithAtomicDesign/marginal-productivity.png" alt="marginal productivity" width="100%" />

???

- This is what happened to the Buffer codebase as we added more engineers over a period of 5 years.
- The commits per person decreased.
- As each person joined, everyone else became less productive.
- This happens because of good old fashioned tech debt.
- It also happens because as you increase team size, you increase complexity and overhead as everyone's work is tangled up in everyone else's.
- If you recognize this kind of a graph, this talk is for you.

# The Mythical Rewrite

???

- This is the point where companies face The Death Choice.
- Stop and rewrite, knowing that you'll freeze feature development (or have to build things twice).
- Many are familiar with the Basecamp rewite story
- Few know the stories of the companies that never came out the other side of the mythical rewrite because they never lived to tell the story.
- That leaves the other option: keep hacking away, making small adjustments, and walking down that declining marginal productivity curve, adding more engineers and complexity as you try stagger along some development.
- This looks a lot like a slow death - all those “didn’t stay agile” “couldn’t keep up” “stopped innovating” companies.
- Many of us have been there.
- We got into this spot because our stack is not very amenable to change, and most importantly we didn't write code to handle change.
- now the only options feel like bad options.

---

class: segue

# There's a _third_ option

???

- There's a third option here: the asynchronous rewrite, to move to an architecture that is better at handling change
- This is where Atomic Design helps us out

# Atom

```html
<label for="text-input">Search This Site</label>
```

<label for="text-input">Search This Site</label>

```html
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter Keyword" id="text-input"/>
```

<input type="text" placeholder="Enter Keyword" id="text-input"/>

```html
<button>Search</button>
```

<button>Search</button>

???

- work in many different contexts
- highly reusable
- not useful on their own

# Molecule

**Search Component**

```html
<div>
  <div>
    <label for="text-input">Search This Site</label>

  </div>
  <input type="text" placeholder="Enter Keyword" id="text-input"/>
  <button>Search</button>
</div>

???

- made of atoms stitched together
- work in a number of different context but designed for a task

---

# Organism

<img src="{{baseurl}}/images/AtomicDesign/page-web.png" alt="organism" width="50%" />

???

- made of atoms and molecules stitched together
- this is where context is set and business logic defined
  - context = state
  - business logic = set of operations to manipulate state
- useful on its own, this is something you could put in front of a customer

---

class: segue

# Template » Page

???

- not quite as useful for building single page applications
  - typically all the atoms and molecules live within 1 to 2 screens
  - many of your atoms and molecules are implemented as templates so it kind of breaks the metaphor
- more useful for building things like marketing sites or blogs with lots of posts

# Buffer Migration Process

---

# Create Atom Library

<iframe src="https://bufferapp.github.io/buffer-components/" height="70%" width="100%" frameBorder="0"/>

???

- This is a library that is used to develop atoms
- at this stage just setting up the dev environment
  - we chose tools like React Storybook and Jest snapshots
- [Buffer Components](https://github.com/bufferapp/buffer-components)

---

# Create Molecule Library

<iframe src="https://bufferapp.github.io/buffer-web-components/?selectedKind=Post&selectedStory=default&full=0&down=1&left=1&panelRight=0&downPanel=kadirahq%2Fstorybook-addon-actions%2Factions-panel" height="70%" width="100%" frameBorder="0" />

???

- This is a library that is used to develop molecules
- [Buffer Web Components](https://github.com/bufferapp/buffer-web-components)

---

# Migrate Atom In Existing App

- Pick something small like `Text`
- Build `Text` in the Atom Library
- Replace one `Text` element with the new Atom

```html
<Text bold>Some Bold Text</Text>
```

<label style="font-weight: bold;">Some Bold Text</label>

???

- text component is nice because it doesn't require user interaction
- focus on the logistics of bringing an atom into the application, ex. NPM
- deploy it, and if no one notices SUCCESS

]

???

- Assemble the feature in your existing application and set the context

---

class: segue

# Approach 1: IFrames

???

- Excellent for guarding CSS
- Lots of usage of postMessage
  - Showing and hiding overlays or tooltips
  - Triggering UI updates in the parent frame
  - Difficult to utilize existing resources (like websockets)

---

class: segue

# Approach 2: Inline Styles + Unset CSS

???

- Requires resetting specific rules set in global scope
  - call out specificity here
- New overlays can be implemented in atoms and molecules
- Easily use existing websockets
- Can utilize existing codebase

---

# Build New Application Shell

???

- At this point you're ready to start building a home for your new atoms and molecules

---

class: center, middle

<img src="{{baseurl}}/images/MigrateWithAtomicDesign/migrate.png" alt="migrate" width="65%" />

???

- New features are shipped in existing application then assembled in new application
- things like navigation for new application will need to be built at this stage
- Iterate until all customers can be moved to new application

# What does development look like?

---

class: segue

# Build in the **most productive** environment

???

- It should be faster to get work done locally than in production
- Developers should be using the most effective tools right now

---

class: title

<img
  src="{{baseurl}}/images/MigrateWithAtomicDesign/storybook-icon.png"   
  alt="jest"
  width="25%"
  style="position: absolute; top: 25%; left: 15%;"

# and

  src="{{baseurl}}/images/MigrateWithAtomicDesign/jest-outline.svg"
  alt="jest"
  width="25%"
  style="position: absolute; top: 25%; right: 15%;"
/>

???

- right now that's using tools like storybook and jest snapshots
  - these things will likely change
- things that won't change
  - isolated environment
  - think about component API first
  - state last (if at all)
- Development across projects should feel the same

# Build For A Changing Future

- Should be easy to rebuild something if needed (modular)
- Rewrite while continuously shipping features
- Dev environment should be most productive environment

???

- we're here because JS is in our lives for one reason or another
- JS is constantly changing, getting better and different (along with the tooling)
- It is very likely we're writing code that will need to be rewritten
- So if you do a rewrite, do it while continuously shipping features, build it modularly
  - microservice best practices (no larger than 2 weeks to rewrite)
