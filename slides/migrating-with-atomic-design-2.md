# That's not exactly true but it gets _less true_ over time

???

- Codebases grow unwieldy over time.
- Maybe you keep ahead of your tech debt and you push that back.
- Maybe you pile it up and you get into a situation like this:

???

- This is what happened to the Buffer codebase as we added more engineers over a period of 5 years.
- The commits per person decreased.
- As each person joined, everyone else became less productive.
- This happens because of good old fashioned tech debt.
- It also happens because as you increase team size, you increase complexity and overhead as everyone's work is tangled up in everyone else's.
- If you recognize this kind of a graph, this talk is for you.

# The Mythical Rewrite

???

- This is the point where companies face The Death Choice.
- Stop and rewrite, knowing that you'll freeze feature development (or have to build things twice).
- Everyone knows the eBay story. No one knows the stories of the companies that never came out the other side of the mythical rewrite unless you go to failcon a lot.
- That leaves the other option: keep hacking away, making small adjustments, and walking down that declining marginal productivity curve, adding more engineers and complexity as you try stagger along some development.
- This looks a lot like a slow death - all those “didn’t stay agile” “couldn’t keep up” “stopped innovating” companies.
- Many of us have been there.
